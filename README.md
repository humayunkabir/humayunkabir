### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Over the last five years, I've been engaged with web development focusing on intuitive UI and better UX. Experienced with building a pack of web templates, web apps, plugins, frameworks, and tools, I never stopped learning new things. Considering the other traits, I'm a team player, dedicated, fast learner, highly tech-enthusiast, and a genuine bug fixer. My start-up-friendly career is my biggest asset to trade with the excellence of the institutions where Iâ€™d like to work.
